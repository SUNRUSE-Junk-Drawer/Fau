# Fau (.NET Standard)

Tools for reading and writing C# arrays to and from Fau byte streams.

This package includes an `ArraySet` type which represents both a schema and a single instance of that schema; just `new ArraySet()` and you should be able to follow Intellisense from there to add arrays, read them from byte streams, and write them to byte streams.

Please see the [project readme](https://github.com/jameswilddev/Fau/blob/production/readme.md) for further details.
