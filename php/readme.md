# Fau (PHP)

Tools for reading and writing PHP arrays to and from Fau byte streams.

This package includes an `ArraySet` type which represents both a schema and a single instance of that schema; just `new ArraySet()` and you should be able to call methods to add arrays, read and write Fau byte streams.

Please see the [project readme](https://github.com/jameswilddev/Fau/blob/production/readme.md) for further details.
